# REMOVED: sample_policies.yaml

# The sample policy YAML that used to live here was removed as part of
# cleaning up mock/sample data. If you need to store real policies, add
# one or more YAML files with a top-level `policies:` key to
# `data/policies/`. The `scripts/load_policies.py` script will load any
# `.yaml`/`.yml` files present in that directory.

# (File intentionally left as a placeholder to avoid accidental deletes by
# scripts/tools that expect this path.)
